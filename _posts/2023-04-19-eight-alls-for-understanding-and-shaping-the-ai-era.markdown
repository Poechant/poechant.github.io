I am Mike Captain, a product manager focusing on the AI field. We often find ourselves constrained by current product forms, making it difficult to think about truly AI-native products. While pondering on how to build AI-native products, I have summarized the following eight points. I hope sharing them with you will be helpful:

1. All social interactions can be non-human communication
2. All content can be created by machines.
3. All interfaces can be displayed with personalization.
4. All interactions can be through natural language.
5. All tasks can be delegated to machines.
6. All true selves can be represented by digital avatars.
7. All employees can be artificial intelligence.
8. All tools can be intelligently reshaped.

I welcome everyone to discuss AI-related products, technology, and business thoughts with me.
